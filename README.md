# Virtual Reality Spatial Perception of Avatars Study

### Summary
This project is focused around finding age-related differences in how children and adults perceive space in virtual reality. Currently, there is very little information on how children perceive and process virtual environments. In the age range where children's cognitive, physical, and spatial reasoning skills are easily shapeable and rapidly developing, a key question to examine is how these changes affect their performance in and utility of virtual environments. This environment explores how children reason about virtual spaces in comparison to adults.

### The Experimental Task 
 The virtual environment accepts input of the subject's foot measurement in cm and produces a range of shoes measuring from 0.5 to 1.5 times the measurement. The subject is to decide and select which shoe size best fits their real-life size before repeating the same process in the next scene. All subject information and selection results are automatically recorded to a text file. 

### Testing and Trials
To be performed.

### Usage
To run the application, clone the repository and open the project in Unity. The project was developed in and is known to work with Unity 2019.3.0a6.

### Contributors
This environment was designed by Irisa Myint.  
Shoe models were found on http://rigmodels.com/model.php?view=Shoes_3d_model__UAJSNSRSJDYY6X9ZSBXGU7TF1.
This project was carried out under the supervision of Dr. Robert Bodenheimer at Vanderbilt University in collaboration with the University of Utah.
